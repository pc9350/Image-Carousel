# Image-Carousel
Hi everyone,

I am an upcoming web developer and tried to use my javascript skills to create an image carousel. I am really proud of this project as I learnt a lot and spent a lot of time on debugging. I used HTML and CSS to design the page and mainly used the transform property to move the images and applied javascript concepts like event handlers,functions,loops,arrays and concepts like string interpolation. 

Thanks,
Pranav
